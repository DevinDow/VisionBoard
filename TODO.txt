BUG: Play not using modified Items' positions

- Scaling code can be improved (for Windows Screensaver preview window & when VB doesn't fit Window)
	- center offset is not right
	- ideally Background bitmap lines up with Screensavr

- Draw in reverse order
- longer pause, number hotkeys for pause duration, space hotkey for pause/unpause, arrow hotkeys for advancing

BUG: Image.FromFile() locks file, therefore save fails on locked filenames

- Captions
	- add Captions
	- rename files?
