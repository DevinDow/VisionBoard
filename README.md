# VisionBoard

Create your own **Vision Board**.

Use pictures you have on your computer or find pictures on the Internet. 

Set your **Vision Board** as you desktop background, or print a copy for your wall or the fridge, or watch your images fly as your screen saver (my personal favorite feature).

Before you know it, your visions will come to you!

Enjoy!

## Install

Place *VisionBoard.exe* anywhere & launch it.

## Instructions

**VisionBoard** lets you build a Vision Board on your computer using images from the internet or your computer instead of having to cut out magazine clippings.

Simply find an image on the Internet or MS Word or MS Paint, right-click it and select *Copy*, then right-click in **Vision Board** where you want to *Paste* it.

You can click on an image to move, rotate, scale, or delete it (using the handles).

You can then animate your **Vision Board** using the View|Play menu, print your **Vision Board**, set it as your **Windows Background**, and set it as your **Screen Saver**.

To install the **Screensaver**, click the "Set as Screensaver" menu item.  The app will create *VisionBoard.scr* and copy your current VisionBoard to *\My Documents\VisionBoard.vbd*.
